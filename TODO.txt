Current status:

- Just finished building driver program and running it on a test file
- Build the higher level, in terms of an AdifFile (as opposed to AdiFile?) with
  an AdifHeader and list of AdifRecords (which would have maps of field names to
  field values).
  - Then build the ADIF parser that takes as input an AdiFile and generates an
    AdifFile.
  - This should probably store header metadata as it processes the header, then
    use that as it processes each record (as opposed to taking another pass
    through the whole file to match up header metadata with each record)
- More CLI programs:
  - basic reporting program
  - import/export exerciser

Design notes:
- should "<eor>" and "<eoh>" (case-insensitively) be their own tokens?  would
  require more lookahead in the tokenizer. (probably not because that text
  should be legal inside values)
