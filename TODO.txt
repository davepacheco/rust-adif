Current status:

- Build the ADI parser that takes a raw string and generates an AdiFile?
  - Working on adi_import_read_token().
    Next steps:
    - hit my first hard borrow checker error!  Not sure how to resolve it.
      See example in docs:
      https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/trait.BufRead.html#examples-1
    - build a wrapper function that invokes it in a loop on an input stream and
      prints out each of the tokens.
- Back to the structures for the "physical" representation of the file ("ADI").
  - See XXXs.
  - Build out physical types?
- Build the higher level, in terms of an AdifFile (as opposed to AdiFile?) with
  an AdifHeader and list of AdifRecords (which would have maps of field names to
  field values).
- Then build the ADIF parser that takes as input an AdiFile and generates an
  AdifFile.
- Build a driver program (or a few?) with a few basic functions:
  - import file and report on it?
  - import file and export the parsed version again?
