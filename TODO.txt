Current status:
- have ADI importer
- have ADIF layer that turns that into AdifFile
- have simple adif_dump program with basic filtering and output fields
- have primordial adif_diff program

General TODO (not necessarily in this order):
- adif_diff could have flags for the list of fields to compare
- Features:
  - Application-specific fields
    - This should probably store header metadata as it processes the header, then
      use that as it processes each record (as opposed to taking another pass
      through the whole file to match up header metadata with each record)
  - User-defined fields
    - See note on app-specific fields
  - Deal with differently-typed values better (i.e., if it's a date, represent it
    with a date type)
  - adif_dump: more concise mode for printing records
- Code improvements:
  - AdifParseError could be a struct with a byte offset, "location" string, and a
    Kind field that looks like the Enum we have today
  - Should AdifRecord have first-class fields for major fields like "call"?
  - Clean up library interface?
  - Clean up internal interfaces
- CLI programs:
  - adif_report: summarize QSOs in a file (e.g., by country, county, ...)
  - adi_to_adx: would this be hard?
- Add Rust documentation
- Add Rust tests!

Design notes:
- should "<eor>" and "<eoh>" (case-insensitively) be their own tokens?  would
  require more lookahead in the tokenizer. (probably not because that text
  should be legal inside values)
