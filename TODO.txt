Current status:

- Build a driver program (or a few?) with a few basic functions:
  - import file and report on it?
    - try this with my existing log files
  - import file and export the parsed version again?
- Build the higher level, in terms of an AdifFile (as opposed to AdiFile?) with
  an AdifHeader and list of AdifRecords (which would have maps of field names to
  field values).
  - Then build the ADIF parser that takes as input an AdiFile and generates an
    AdifFile.
  - This should probably store header metadata as it processes the header, then
    use that as it processes each record (as opposed to taking another pass
    through the whole file to match up header metadata with each record)

General issues:
- I think it's a general bug that if there are two STRING tokens together, they
  don't get concatenated as they should.
- should "<eor>" and "<eoh>" (case-insensitively) be their own tokens?  would
  require more lookahead in the tokenizer.
