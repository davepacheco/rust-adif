Current status:

- Still fleshing out the structures for the "physical" representation of the
  file ("ADI").
  - See XXXs.
  - Build out physical types?
- Consider building the ADI parser that takes a raw string and generates an
  AdiFile?
- Build the higher level, in terms of an AdifFile (as opposed to AdiFile?) with
  an AdifHeader and list of AdifRecords (which would have maps of field names to
  field values).
- Then build the ADIF parser that takes as input an AdiFile and generates an
  AdifFile.
- Build a driver program (or a few?) with a few basic functions:
  - import file and report on it?
  - import file and export the parsed version again?
